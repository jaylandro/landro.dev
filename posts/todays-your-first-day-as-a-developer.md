summary: Integrating into a companies culture, eco-system & workflow is a
  journey without a map. Regardless of the number of on-boarding checklists you

First Off, **Congratulations ðŸŽ‰!**\

Getting hired in 2020 is no minor task, 10s-100s of rejections, ghosts, bad fits and countless technical interrogations. You are on the other side. \
\
What now?

1. **Ask as many questions as possible**. Seriously, with every piece of information, if you don't understand an **acronym,** are not sure what a **whole chunk** of the organization even does or don't know who to talk to about setting up your email.... **Ask questions**. If you are feeling shy or un-empowered to ask, ask if you can **slack/email** your questions. This not only builds relationships with people outside of your immediate team, it saves lots of time operating under false assumptions. Keep asking questions for a Month, maybe longer....

2. Get your **development environment** set-up. Frequently organizations code structure matches their org structure. Pay close attention to the docs, try to get as much done as possible simply by following the **README.md** file. If you find errors/inaccuracies, it's a perfect chance to **submit your first PR.** This highlights the companies commitment to documentation and developer experience. \
